### Key Features

1. **High-Speed Network Assault**  
   The **REDLOTUS Ultra Low Orbit Ion Cannon** is designed to perform high-speed data transmission attacks at rates of up to **50 Pbps**, provided the user has access to a fast network infrastructure. This allows users to execute powerful network disruption operations, flooding target systems with overwhelming amounts of data in a matter of seconds.

2. **Global Range**  
   The range of the **Ultra Low Orbit Ion Cannon** is effectively global, though its reach and impact are entirely dependent on the user’s network connectivity. When connected to a robust and high-speed network, the augment allows users to disrupt networks and servers across the globe.

3. **DDoS Attack Execution**  
   One of the primary functions of the **Ultra Low Orbit Ion Cannon** is to execute distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. By flooding target servers or networks with massive volumes of data, the augment can force systems offline or severely impair their functionality, rendering them inaccessible.

4. **Firewall Disruption**  
   The augmentation includes tools for bypassing or disrupting firewalls, allowing users to gain access to protected networks or destabilize secure systems. It utilizes a combination of high-speed data transmission and advanced network attack techniques to break through defensive barriers.

5. **Neural Command and Control**  
   The **Ultra Low Orbit Ion Cannon** operates through a neural interface, giving the user direct control over the timing, intensity, and targets of their network attacks. This control is facilitated through the **DeepLink Neural Command Center** and **DeepLink Infolink**, ensuring a seamless integration between the user’s neural signals and the augment's functionality.

6. **Low-Cost Accessibility**  
   Despite its advanced capabilities, the **Ultra Low Orbit Ion Cannon** is priced at a relatively low cost of **USD$99 (CN¥725)**, making it accessible to a wide range of users involved in cyber warfare or network defense operations. Its affordability, combined with its powerful capabilities, makes it a popular tool for those engaged in large-scale cyber disruption efforts.

### Applications

- **Cyber Warfare**  
   The **Ultra Low Orbit Ion Cannon** is designed for use in cyber warfare, where high-speed, large-scale attacks on enemy networks are required. It enables users to conduct disruptive operations against critical infrastructure, government systems, or corporate networks.

- **DDoS Attacks**  
   The augment excels at executing DDoS attacks, making it suitable for both offensive cyber operations and covert sabotage efforts. By flooding networks and servers with overwhelming data, users can disable websites, disrupt services, and target key online systems.

- **Firewall Penetration**  
   The ability to bypass or disable firewalls makes the **Ultra Low Orbit Ion Cannon** useful for hackers, cyber operatives, or intelligence agents who need to penetrate secure networks. The augmentation's high-speed attack capabilities allow for efficient entry into otherwise inaccessible systems.

- **Network Security Testing**  
   In a defensive capacity, the **Ultra Low Orbit Ion Cannon** can be used by network security professionals to test the robustness of firewalls, network defenses, and server infrastructure by simulating large-scale attacks. This makes it a useful tool in vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
