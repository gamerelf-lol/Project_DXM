### **Integrated HEPA Filtration System (IHFS)**

**Type**: Internal Filtration Augmentation  
**Primary Function**: Filters harmful particles, toxins, and airborne contaminants from the respiratory system, designed for augmented individuals working or living in hazardous environments.

### Overview

The **Integrated HEPA Filtration System (IHFS)** is an internal augmentation designed to filter out airborne pollutants, toxins, and particulate matter, allowing augmented individuals to breathe safely in environments where air quality is compromised. Whether in industrial zones with heavy pollution, combat areas with chemical agents, or megacity slums with poor air quality, the IHFS provides a high-efficiency solution for protecting the respiratory system.

Developed by **Novamedica**, this system works in tandem with both natural respiratory functions and cybernetic lung augmentations. Utilizing advanced HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filtration technology, the IHFS filters out up to 99.97% of particles, including dust, bacteria, and airborne contaminants down to 0.3 microns in size. Additionally, IHFS can be paired with bioengineered respiratory implants to enhance overall breathing efficiency.

### Technical Specifications

- **Size**: Approx. 5 cm x 2 cm, implantable in the chest cavity, directly connected to the respiratory system.
  
- **Material**: 
  - Medical-grade titanium shell with bio-compatible polymer lining.
  - Filtration media made of ultra-fine, dense mesh (HEPA standard).

- **Filtration Capacity**:  
  - Filters 99.97% of particles â‰¥ 0.3 microns (including dust, bacteria, and chemical toxins).
  - Includes activated carbon layers for gas and vapor filtration (e.g., industrial fumes, volatile organic compounds).

- **Operating Mechanism**:  
  - **Inhalation Phase**: As air enters the lungs, it passes through the IHFS filtration module where contaminants are trapped in the HEPA filter.
  - **Exhalation Phase**: Filtered air exits through a low-resistance airflow system, ensuring minimal impact on natural breathing patterns.

- **Power Source**:  
  - Self-sustaining bioelectric power harvested from natural bodily functions, with minimal energy draw.
  
- **Maintenance**:  
  - Requires filter replacement every 3-6 months, depending on environmental conditions and usage.
  - Routine check-ups (every 6-12 months) are recommended for diagnostics and efficiency tests.

- **Installation**:  
  - Surgically implanted in the chest cavity, generally as an add-on to respiratory or lung augmentation procedures.
  - Compatible with most cybernetic lung replacements and bioengineered respiratory systems.

- **Weight**:  
  - Approx. 150 grams (including filter media).

- **Airflow Capacity**:  
  - Supports standard breathing rates of 12-20 breaths per minute, with adjustable airflow for increased physical activity (up to 40 breaths per minute in high-stress conditions).

- **Durability**:  
  - HEPA filter media designed to withstand harsh industrial or hazardous conditions for extended periods.
  - Encased in a corrosion-resistant titanium shell to protect against environmental damage or physical impacts.

- **Compatibility**:  
  - Compatible with most augmented respiratory systems, including full cybernetic lung replacements and bioengineered lung tissues.
  - Can be paired with neural respiratory control systems to regulate airflow based on activity levels and environmental conditions.

### Key Features

1. **High-Efficiency Filtration**:  
   - Filters out microscopic particles, including harmful pollutants, toxins, bacteria, and airborne viruses, providing maximum respiratory protection in environments with compromised air quality.
  
2. **Low-Resistance Airflow**:  
   - The IHFS is designed to provide minimal airflow resistance, allowing users to breathe normally even under high filtration loads, making it suitable for combat situations or high-intensity physical labor.
  
3. **Self-Cleaning Mechanism**:  
   - The system includes a low-level self-cleaning feature that periodically ejects particulate buildup through micro-expulsions during exhalation, extending the lifespan of the filter between replacements.

4. **Activated Carbon Layer**:  
   - In addition to particulate filtration, IHFS incorporates an activated carbon layer to capture toxic gases and volatile compounds, further protecting the user from airborne chemical agents and industrial pollutants.
  
5. **Integration with Cybernetic Lung Systems**:  
   - IHFS is fully compatible with cybernetic respiratory systems, offering seamless integration for users with mechanical lung replacements or enhanced breathing systems, ensuring continuous filtration without sacrificing performance.
