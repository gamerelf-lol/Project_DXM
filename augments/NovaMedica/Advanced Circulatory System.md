### Overview

The **NovaMedica Advanced Circulatory System (ACS)** is an augmentation designed to enhance and regulate the body's circulatory functions, developed by **NovaMedica**, a leader in medical and cybernetic enhancements. The ACS is engineered for individuals with significant physical or cognitive augmentations, where traditional circulatory systems struggle to meet the increased demand for oxygen, nutrients, and bioelectric regulation.

The **ACS** augments the natural cardiovascular system with bioengineered blood vessels, synthetic organs (such as an artificial heart), and micro-valves designed to efficiently pump blood and distribute nutrients throughout the body. This advanced system ensures that both organic tissue and mechanical augmentations receive the necessary oxygen and energy to operate at peak performance. The ACS is ideal for labor-intensive professions, military personnel, or individuals with compromised circulatory health due to injuries or augmentations.

### Technical Specifications

- **Size and Components**:  
  - **Artificial Heart**: Approx. 6 cm x 4 cm, made from synthetic muscle fibers and a bio-compatible titanium shell.
  - **Synthetic Arteries and Veins**: Composed of flexible, reinforced bio-polymer material capable of self-repair and nanofiber mesh integration with organic tissue.
  - **Micro-Valves**: Implanted along major arteries to regulate blood flow during high-stress conditions, ensuring consistent oxygen and nutrient delivery.
  - **Internal Sensors**: Real-time monitoring of blood pressure, oxygen levels, and nutrient distribution.

- **Material**:  
  - Medical-grade titanium and bio-compatible polymers for synthetic organs and vessels.
  - Nanofiber mesh for tissue integration, allowing smooth interaction between organic and synthetic components.
  - Self-healing bio-polymer capable of repairing micro-tears or damage to blood vessels.

- **Key Features**:
  1. **Optimized Blood Flow**:  
     - Bioengineered blood vessels are wider and more flexible than natural ones, reducing strain on the heart and allowing for greater blood flow during high-performance activities.
  2. **Enhanced Oxygen Delivery**:  
     - ACS ensures that all body tissues, including mechanical augmentations, receive optimal oxygen levels, reducing fatigue and enhancing overall stamina.
  3. **Nutrient Distribution**:  
     - Works in conjunction with bioengineered food systems like **N-FOCS** to ensure that nutrients are delivered efficiently to both organic and mechanical components.
  4. **Temperature Regulation**:  
     - Synthetic vessels include built-in micro-channels for heat exchange, helping regulate body temperature in extreme environments.

- **Power Source**:  
  - ACS operates through bioelectrical energy generated from the body's natural functions and supplemented by internal energy cells, which recharge via metabolic activity. These energy cells are designed to last several years without the need for replacement.

- **Maintenance**:  
  - Requires routine diagnostics every 12 months to ensure system functionality and prevent blockages or mechanical wear in synthetic organs.
  - Artificial heart and synthetic blood vessels can last up to 10-15 years with proper maintenance before needing replacement or upgrades.

- **Installation**:  
  - Surgical implantation is required for full integration of the ACS, involving the replacement of major blood vessels and the heart with bioengineered components. Typically performed in stages, this procedure is only carried out in certified NovaMedica clinics.
  
- **Performance**:  
  - Increased endurance and strength in augmented individuals due to optimized oxygen delivery and blood flow.
  - Faster recovery from physical exertion or injury, as the ACS promotes accelerated healing and nutrient delivery to damaged tissue.

- **Compatibility**:  
  - Fully compatible with most major augmentations, including cybernetic limbs, neural implants, and nutrient processing systems (such as **BIONEX HENP**). The system can also adapt to extreme environments, making it suitable for individuals working in hazardous conditions or high-altitude areas.

- **Weight**:  
  - Approx. 1.5 kg total, including the artificial heart and synthetic vessels.
