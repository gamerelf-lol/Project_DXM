### Key Features

1. **High-Speed Data Extraction**  
   The **DARKLOTUS Neural Data Breach Augment** is capable of accessing and extracting vast amounts of data from compromised neural systems or AI-linked databases. Its high-speed transfer capabilities allow for the retrieval of encrypted files, sensitive information, and memory archives in a matter of seconds, making it highly effective for quick, covert operations.

2. **QuantumVault™ Decryption Suite**  
   The onboard **QuantumVault™** decryption software is designed to bypass the most advanced encryption protocols, including those used in military and corporate neural systems. It automatically analyzes and decrypts neural firewalls and data barriers, ensuring that extracted data is readily usable for analysis or exploitation.

3. **BlackCloak™ Stealth Protocols**  
   The augment is equipped with **BlackCloak™**, a set of stealth protocols that ensures the data breach remains undetected. BlackCloak™ conceals the user’s neural signature and cloaks the data transfer, minimizing the risk of triggering security alerts or leaving a digital footprint.

4. **Neural and AI Data Access**  
   The augment can infiltrate both human neural systems and AI-driven interfaces, making it versatile for use in a wide range of scenarios. It can extract cognitive data from human-augmented systems, as well as operational data from AI servers and control systems integrated with neural networks.

5. **Real-Time Target Mapping**  
   The augment includes a real-time scanning function that maps out nearby augmented individuals or AI hubs, identifying vulnerable access points for data extraction. This feature allows the user to quickly assess targets and initiate data breaches with precision.

6. **Encrypted Data Storage**  
   Extracted data is stored locally in a highly encrypted format, ensuring that it cannot be easily traced or accessed by unauthorized parties. The augment has 10 terabytes of local storage, and can optionally sync with offsite encrypted cloud storage if connected to a network.
