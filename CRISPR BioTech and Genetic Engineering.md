# Who is CRISPR BioTech and Genetic Engineering?

CRISPR BioTech and Genetic Engineering is a cutting-edge biotechnology corporation specializing in advanced genetic manipulation and bioengineering.

Key Inventions, among other things:

### BIONEX Hyper-Efficient Nutrient Processors (HENP)

A nutrient system that extracts and delivers bioengineered components designed for rapid assimilation into augmented bodies, ensuring maximum endurance and vitality.

### N-FOCS (Nutrient Formula for Optimized Cybernetic Sustenance), brand name NeuroFuel™

A CRISPR BioTech flagship product, brand name NeuroFuel™, is an ultra-nutrient-dense food designed specifically for augmented individuals. While most bioengineered food is bland and tasteless, NeuroFuel™ is engineered to meet the exact caloric and nutritional requirements of heavily augmented workers, providing the necessary sustenance to power both their human and mechanical components. It is a compact, tasteless substance consumed in small quantities to maximize efficiency.

### BIONEX Cybernetic Soft-Tissue Integration (CSTI)
Genetically modified tissues are grown to integrate seamlessly with cybernetic parts.
