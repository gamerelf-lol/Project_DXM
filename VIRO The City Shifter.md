# Project VIRO: The City Shifter

Project: VIRO, or (the Variable Infrastructure Re-Organization Algorithm) was launched in 2089 by Virex Dynamics, heralded as a revolutionary urban planning and development initiative. The goal of the project was to create a dynamic, self-adjusting city that would constantly optimize its layout for efficiency, population growth, and the unique developmental needs of augmented citizens.

### Initial Launch and Success, 2089

In its early stages, Project VIRO was considered a breakthrough in urban technology. The system used vast AI-powered algorithms to predict population trends, urban stress points, and resource allocation needs, and then seamlessly reconfigured buildings, streets, and infrastructure to accommodate growth. It prioritized augmented humans, ensuring that workplaces, living spaces, and transit systems were optimized for those who had enhancements, making their daily routines more efficient.

### The Decline, 2095

By the mid-2090s, VIRO began to encounter problems. As the population surged and space within the megacity became increasingly limited, the system's original algorithms were no longer sufficient to handle the sheer complexity of the city’s needs. With a growing divide between the wealthy, augmented elite and the lower-class populations, VIRO’s algorithms began to skew heavily toward the elite and more functional augments, neglecting poorer areas and older, malfunctioning augmented citizens.

### The Labyrinth Era, 2101

By the early 2100s, Project VIRO had become infamous, especially among the lower-class. The lower districts became a chaotic maze where buildings could shift overnight without warning, trapping residents in dead-end streets or cutting them off from essential services. This instability turned the megacity into a two-tiered environment: an upper city that enjoyed stable surroundings, and a lower slums where the impoverished and failed augments struggled for survival.

### Corporate Abandonment, 2110

By 2110, Virex Dynamics had largely abandoned Project VIRO, leaving it to run on autopilot.

Despite public outcry, especially from those trapped in the labyrinthine slums, the corporate elites saw no benefit in fixing the malfunctioning system. With most of the city’s core infrastructure functioning for the augmented elite, the destabilization of poorer districts was viewed as an acceptable consequence.

### Current State of the Lower VIRO Zones, Present

While much of the lower city is chaotic and unpredictable, the augmentations of the lower city's inhabitants have evolved in response to the ever-shifting environment, allowing them to treat this chaotic landscape as navigable terrain. These augmentations grant them distinct advantages over those who cannot adapt, particularly the pures or the elites who rarely need to traverse the ever-changing urban jungle.

Their cybernetic enhancements heighten their ability to sense changes in the urban layout before they happen, giving them an edge. Some augments are equipped with mapping interfaces that can track the building shifts in real-time, while others have agility boosters or reflex-enhancing mods that help them escape sudden obstacles. In the lower VIRO zones, these augmentations turn the environment into a dangerous playground that they alone can master, using the chaos to their advantage in combat, escape, or covert operations.
