Labyrinth-like megacities that shift shabby buildings in the common section often. 

Main characters' base resides in place of seldom shift.
-> what kind of place would seldom shift in this city?
a place that wasn't detected
deep underground
high in the sky
alternate dimension
purchased-land in the rich area

Main characters don't regard mega-corp's 'super augmented' as humans. Just here puppets/bots.

With less superaugs, there will be more space that doesn't shift.

What are augmented?
Human machine integration. Many are regarded as tools, foot soldiers, base-line workers who can do jobs better than humans.
They eat food that was manufactured to be nutritious, have no taste, etc. (oatmeal/bioengineered food!)
They are incapable of reproduction after a certain generation.
Generation 3/4 (middle) are still very capable of emotion and use augments for fun. 
Children augmented also have higher degree of emotion as opposed to older augmented.
Many elements in city are cyber-esque or augmented. Things like birds are meant to give children just enough element of real life as to not drive them insane.

What is the overarching conflict ?
Mega-corp, seeking to take control over everything in neutra-corp, initiates project OVERMIND.
Main characters want to stop project OVERMIND.

OVERMIND
sentient AI
Project meant to give humans complete control of AI and augments
Give Mega-corp control over planet

What is Project VIRO?
Program that rearranged city buildings, optimizing for augmented's developmental conditions and available space!
In the previous generations, it actually did this, but as space became more limited, it creates labyrinth-like city.
Abandoned and left alone because mega-corp doesn't want to fix it and it doesn't cause problems.
 
Megacity
Largest concentration of humans where the most aesthetic and functional augmented reside.

Slums are full of augmented that were used as trials, ones with bugs, dysfunctional ones, or ones that served a defeated cause (their owners were cast out or killed or something).
