# Who Are the Augmented?

The augmented are individuals who have replaced or modified one or more of their natural human parts with prosthetic or cybernetic enhancements, designed to improve daily life, productivity, or personal capabilities. Augmentations range from simple prosthetics to complex systems that radically alter both the body and mind. The scope of augmentation can vary widely, from physical enhancements to sensory and cognitive modifications, making the augmented population a diverse group.
